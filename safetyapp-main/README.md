#  SafetyApp - FIT3178 iOS dev project 


## 1. Introduction:

This app is aimed at helping people who are in danger or feel unsafe. The app will allow users to send a message to their emergency contacts with their location and a message. The app will also allow
users to call the police if needed. 

## 2. Changes:

However, due to time limitation and unrealistic scopes. There are certain functions that are not implemented in this app. For example, the app does not have chat funtions, apple or google log in.
those extra functions. Nevertheless, this has been discussed with the demonstrator, thus, this should not be any issue. 

## 3. General Information: 
 
For this project, I have used a mix of storyboard and programmatic UI. The reason for this is because I have found that using storyboard is easier to design the UI. Which means there are a fair
amount of UI codes, and this should be fairly self-explainatory. And commenting isn't a viable option. I only do commenting for what I am doing overall due to the repetitiveness of it. 

Other than this, comments are there to explain rather concept. In general, I follow OOP style of coding. 
The naming should be quite self-explainatory as well. 

## 4. Requirment before using 

Please download cocapods in your current system if you wished to run the app on XCode.

## 4. Reference: 

I didnt use much reference majority of the time I am just debugging which is too much to list and is not reuquired in this case anyway. 
And most of the time it's just resources from Uni and Copliot or ChatGPT.

## 5. Conclusion: 

I hope who ever going through this app can see the effort i have devoted. I have spent way more time than I am expected based on the suggested hours really.
Yet, there are plenty of in perfections and minor bugs potentially. But I have tried my best to accomplish this assignment. 
Meanwhile, I hope you also enjoy the app I have created as my first ios app. 
Lastly, thank you for your time going through this app.
